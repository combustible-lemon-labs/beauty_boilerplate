> This boilerplate is based on [d0pt3's `fivem-ts-boilerplate`](https://github.com/d0p3t/fivem-ts-boilerplate).

> A [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) NUI has been added which, by default, has no configuration and comes with [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com/). You are responsible for adding `show`/`hide` logic, replacing/removing Bootstrap, etc.

This is a basic boilerplate for creating a FiveM resource using Typescript. It includes webpack config files, linting (ESlint + prettier) and a directory structure to get you started. We recommend to use [fivem-js](https://github.com/d0p3t/fivem-js) alongside this boilerplate for faster development of client scripts.

## Usage
1. Clone repository into your `resources/[local]` folder.
2. `npm i` the dependencies.
3. Start development.

### Preact

No additional steps need to be taken to begin using Preact. See `src/html/` for an example.

***Note:*** It's recommended you use the [`lit-html`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html) VSCode extension, or similar for another editor.

### Development
Use `npm run watch` to watch files during development.

### Production
Build your production ready code with `npm run build`.

This will build the client and server script with the `--mode production` flag.

### Automatic Builds (Optional)
The `fxmanifest.lua` is not setup to automatically build upon first FXServer start. If you'd like to setup automatic builds you must add the following to your `fxmanifest.lua`.

```lua
dependency 'yarn'
dependency 'webpack'

webpack_config 'webpack.config.js'
```

However, due to the speed performance of the pre-packaged webpack/yarn of cfx-server-data, we suggest you don't do this and build manually as described previously ("Production").
